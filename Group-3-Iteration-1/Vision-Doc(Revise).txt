Vision Document


Introduction

In this project our objective is to build the board game, Ricochet Robots; allowing the user the ability to save a game in progress, play the game with multiple difficulties, provide support for players with colour vision deficiency & an option to provide in-game hints. 

Problem Statement

Currently, Ricochet Robots is a board game (more so a puzzle) that involves the use of many colourful components & doesn't cater to players with a colour vision deficiency very well. Our application will intrinsically provide capabilities for players with deficiencies while maintaining an equal, seamless experience. *Revise* (state how we're approaching the colour deficiency issue)

Stakeholders & Key Interests

• Players - Playing the game, saving their game sessions, seeing their high scores & achievements, & most importantly having fun.
• Parents - Want the game to be appropriate (PG), the ability to have parental control over the games they buy for their kids
• Government - Implementing regulations in games, creating laws & restrictions, applying censorship
• Distributors - Want to sell the game without complications like regulations or controversies
• Developers - Want to know the new games that are in the market, knowing what's trending & what mechanics consumers want in their game

Summary of System Features

• The system shall create a board game of either two difficulties (Simple/Complex)
• The system shall allow player(s) to play a game involving 4 players (human/computer)
• The system shall allow a player to save game sessions
• The system shall provide functionality for colour deficiency 
• The system shall provide functionality to hint where to move
• The system shall provide a menu for game instructions

Project Risks

Fully and correctly providing functionality for colour vision deficient players may prove difficult due to the inability to provide adequate testing on colour vision deficient players before the release of the application.
